This program is designed to take a set of minterms for a Boolean function with four variables (A, B, C, D) and provide a visual representation of these minterms on a Karnaugh map (K-map). It also outputs the simplified Boolean expression based on the given minterms.

Main Components and Their Functions:
Input Handling:

The program begins by asking the user to input the number of minterms. This determines how many minterms the user will enter.
The user is then prompted to enter each minterm, which should be a number between 0 and 15. These minterms represent the rows and columns in the K-map where the function evaluates to true (1).
K-map Initialization and Population:

A 4x4 array (representing the K-map) is initialized with all zeros. This represents that initially, no minterms are marked as true.
For each entered minterm, the program calculates its corresponding position (row and column) in the K-map:
The row is determined by the higher two bits of the minterm (AB).
The column is determined by the lower two bits of the minterm (CD).
These positions are then marked as 1 in the K-map.
K-map Display:

The K-map is printed in a structured format with row and column headers labeled according to the values of the variables AB and CD.
This helps visualize where the function evaluates to true within the map.
Conversion of Minterms to Boolean Expression:

For each minterm in the K-map marked as 1, the program converts it to its corresponding Boolean expression:
Each bit of the minterm is checked to determine whether the variable should appear in its true form or complemented form (e.g., A or A').
The program constructs the simplified Boolean expression by combining these minterms using the OR operator (represented by +).
Output of the Simplified Boolean Expression:

The resulting Boolean expression is printed, representing the simplified form of the function based on the input minterms.
